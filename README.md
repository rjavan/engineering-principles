Telescope's Engineering Principles
 

# We ship value to customers multiple times per day

Our definition of done is in the hands of our customers. We learn most when we can put something in front of them and see if we're solving their problems. Speed == Learning Cylces. We optimise for learning.


# We peer review every change

Peer review supports delivery of high-quality changes. It can prevent outages and malfunctions caused by bugs, improves aspects of the code such as reducing tech debt and promotes design consistency, learning and knowledge sharing. Peer review results in a wider level of knowledge within the team in question. Internal services that impact our ability to support our external customers are considered production.

# Jump when you're 80% sure

It’s often better to make a fast decision with 80% of the necessary information and analysis than wait until the picture is fully clear. We consult with each other and externally to make the best decision, with the information we have at the time but we are confortable with ambiguity. We recognise that most decisions are two way doors.

# We build exciting things with "boring" technology

We use a well defined technology standards at Telescope. Boring means a toolkit we're all familar with. As our engineering team grows, we need to have the right level of consistency and standardisation. We express our opinions in what we choose to use, ensuring we can then build robust tooling to help support us at scale. We focus on our customers’ problems over repeatedly making technological decisions, which in turn improves our time to production.
